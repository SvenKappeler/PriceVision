# PriceVision

*Underconstuction - We will be updating the ReadMe as we progress*

### PriceVision is a web application designed to provide stock price predictions and sentiment analysis of news for buying and selling stock.

## Features:
- The price prediction model uses a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Network algorithm. 
- Sentiment analysis is conducted on the news related to a particular stock.

This is AAPL stock intial prediction.

This is AMZN stock intial prediction.

## Limitations of stock price prediction 
The prediction model for the stock closing prices has an RMSE value of 3.913 and an MAPE value of 2.117%. The RMSE represents the standard deviation of the residuals, or the differences between the predicted and actual values. A lower RMSE value indicates that the model's predictions are closer to the actual values. In this case, the RMSE value of 3.913 suggests that the model's predictions have an average error of around 3.9 points.

The MAPE, on the other hand, represents the average percentage difference between the predicted and actual values. The lower the MAPE value, the better the model's accuracy. The MAPE value of 2.117% indicates that the model's predictions have an average percentage error of around 2.1%.

Overall, the model seems to perform well in predicting the stock closing prices, with an RMSE value of 3.913 and an MAPE value of 2.117%. However, it's important to note that stock price prediction can be a challenging task depending on diffenrent econimic factors which arent used in this prediction program

We will keep updating the ReadMe as we progress with the development of the application.
